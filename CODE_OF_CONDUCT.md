# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex, experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, political beliefs and ideology, organization or group affiliation,
country of origin, place of residence, mother tongue, personal appearance,
race, caste, color, religion or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our primary goal is building open source projects.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Open-minded approach to new ideas, concepts or different opinions
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Keep responsibility for our own actions and correct the consequences

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Please refrain from:
- Discussions of religion, politics, political personalities, disputed territories, current, past

- Any kind of political activism or campaigning, including but not limited to, posting
  flags and banners, links to petitions, fundraising pages, or other political campaigning

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
